                <h6>Please read this carefully before confirming your booking:</h6>
                     <h6>These booking terms and conditions cover all bookings made on www.jaystravels.co.uk ("Jays Travel") and they will vary depending on whether you make
                a booking with us for a package holiday or whether you purchase flight only, accommodation only or other separate travel arrangements, ("Individual Components").</h6>
                <h6>If you book Individual Components with us, we will make the booking as agent for the relevant supplier (s) (Travel Provider) (e.g. the airline, hotel supplier, 
                    insurance supplier or other ground supplier) and your contract will be subject to the supplier's own terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you, 
                    often in accordance with international conventions. Copies of the supplier's terms and the international conventions are available on request.</h6>
                    <h6>Jays Travel acts as an agent and is not the service provider / operator. When making your booking, Jays Travel will arrange for you to enter into a contract with the principal(s) 
                    or other travel supplier(s) (e.g. tour operator / airline / cruise company / accommodation company) named on your receipt(s) or e-ticket(s). Your contract will be subject to the supplier's
                     own terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you, often in accordance with international conventions. Copies of the supplier's terms and the international conventions are available on request.</h6>
                     <h6>By acting as an agent, this means that we facilitate bookings with those that provide or arrange travel products. If you make a flight only booking with us, your contract will be directly with the airline shown on the e-ticket.
                         As soon as we have issued you with a valid e-ticket, our direct contract with you has been fulfilled. The airline is responsible for the provision of your travel arrangements as well as for any schedule changes and cancellations.</h6>
                         <h6>A contract will come into existence between us only once we accept your booking and we receive your deposit (where permitted) or full payment via cleared funds.We reserve the right to refuse, at our sole discretion, any booking. 
                            For online bookings, the contract will come into existence upon acceptance of the booking conditions presented at the end of the booking process and once we have received full payment via cleared funds.</h6>
                            <h6>We reserve the right to cancel any booking if we have made a mistake in relation to the price. We will ensure that we notify you of such mistakes within 24 hours of your booking, provided your travel has not started yet.</h6>

                            <h6>IMPORTANT:  Jays Travel strongly recommends that you take out travel insurance for any holiday, especially as there may be circumstances where neither Jays Travel nor the travel supplier can accept liability (e.g. delays or cancellations beyond our control).
                             When purchasing travel insurance, we strongly recommend that you check with your insurance provider that your cover includes all eventualities including force majeure.</h6>

                      carriers have now introduced additional charges for checked baggage on either a per piece or by weight basis. It is recommended that cabin 
                      baggage is kept to a minimum. Extra charges may apply for checked baggage in excess of the permitted allowance. Please ask the airline for 
                      more specific information as these rules vary from time to time. You can refer to www.iata.org/bags for information and links. For safety 
                      reasons dangerous articles must not be packed in checked or cabin baggage. Restricted articles include, but are not limited to, compressed
                       gases, corrosives, explosives, flammable liquids and solids, radioactive materials, oxidising materials, poisons, infectious substances
