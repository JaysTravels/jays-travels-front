                        <h6>Please read this carefully before confirming your booking:</h6>
                        <h6>These booking terms and conditions cover all bookings made on www.jaystravels.co.uk ("Jays Travel") and they will vary depending on whether you make
                          a booking with us for a package holiday or whether you purchase flight only, accommodation only or other separate travel arrangements, ("Individual Components").</h6>
                        <h6>If you book Individual Components with us, we will make the booking as agent for the relevant supplier (s) (Travel Provider) (e.g. the airline, hotel supplier,
                          insurance supplier or other ground supplier) and your contract will be subject to the supplier's own terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you,
                          often in accordance with international conventions. Copies of the supplier's terms and the international conventions are available on request.</h6>
                        <h6>Jays Travel acts as an agent and is not the service provider / operator. When making your booking, Jays Travel will arrange for you to enter into a contract with the principal(s)
                          or other travel supplier(s) (e.g. tour operator / airline / cruise company / accommodation company) named on your receipt(s) or e-ticket(s). Your contract will be subject to the supplier's
                          own terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you, often in accordance with international conventions. Copies of the supplier's terms and the international conventions are available on request.</h6>
                        <h6>By acting as an agent, this means that we facilitate bookings with those that provide or arrange travel products. If you make a flight only booking with us, your contract will be directly with the airline shown on the e-ticket.
                          As soon as we have issued you with a valid e-ticket, our direct contract with you has been fulfilled. The airline is responsible for the provision of your travel arrangements as well as for any schedule changes and cancellations.</h6>
                        <h6>A contract will come into existence between us only once we accept your booking and we receive your deposit (where permitted) or full payment via cleared funds.We reserve the right to refuse, at our sole discretion, any booking.
                          For online bookings, the contract will come into existence upon acceptance of the booking conditions presented at the end of the booking process and once we have received full payment via cleared funds.</h6>
                        <h6>We reserve the right to cancel any booking if we have made a mistake in relation to the price. We will ensure that we notify you of such mistakes within 24 hours of your booking, provided your travel has not started yet.</h6>

                        <h6>IMPORTANT:  Jays Travel strongly recommends that you take out travel insurance for any holiday, especially as there may be circumstances where neither Jays Travel nor the travel supplier can accept liability (e.g. delays or cancellations beyond our control).
                          When purchasing travel insurance, we strongly recommend that you check with your insurance provider that your cover includes all eventualities including force majeure.</h6>

                          This applies to outward and homeward journeys, as changes to flight times may be made during your time abroad. Whilst Tickets to India will

                          flights or any additional costs incurred if customers do not follow these instructions. The recommended minimum check-in time for international
                          flights is 3 hours prior to departure and for domestic flights, 2 hours before departure. Additionally we recommend that you contact your
                          airline on the day of travel to ensure that your flight is operating as per schedule.</h6>

                          Jays Travel has no control over the allocation of seats, even if pre-booked with the airline, and can make no guarantee that specific

                        <h6>Seat availability and pricing is at the principal's discretion and is subject to availability. Please note that flight prices can fluctuate.
                          Every care is taken to ensure our online systems are up to date and correct. Please be aware however that as we use third party data, there
                          may be occasions where the prices we show are incorrect or inaccurate. Please accept our apologies for any accidental misrepresentations on
                          this website or other affiliated sites. If your chosen flight is not available for any reason we will contact you immediately and offer
                          alternatives. Alternatives may include changing airlines / routes, increased cost for the original flight requested or a full refund with
                          no penalty or administration fee.</h6>
                        <h6>Airlines may charge for additional services such as checked baggage, airport check-in, preferred seating, in-flight entertainment
                          (if available), food, drink and snacks etc. Any charges for these additional services are not included in the price of your flight
                          ticket and must be paid either to Tickets to India in advance of departure date to avail of any discounted rate, or must be paid
                          to the airline directly. Jays Travel is not responsible for any additional costs incurred and we advise you to contact the
                          relevant airline to add any additional services and verify charges.</h6>
                        <h6>Flights must be used in the order set out in your itinerary; any failure to use the ticket out of order could invalidate the remainder
                          of the ticket and result in automatic cancellation by the airline.</h6>

                          subsequently vary depending on flight schedules, type of aircraft, weather conditions etc. Flight times are indications of the hours spent
                          actually flying (excluding time on the ground during stops en-route or when changing aircraft) and are therefore given for guidance only

                          please refer to their websites. The amount of checked baggage you are allowed depends on your class of travel/destination. Several leading
                          carriers have now introduced additional charges for checked baggage on either a per piece or by weight basis. It is recommended that cabin
                          baggage is kept to a minimum. Extra charges may apply for checked baggage in excess of the permitted allowance. Please ask the airline for
                          more specific information as these rules vary from time to time. You can refer to www.iata.org/bags for information and links. For safety
                          reasons dangerous articles must not be packed in checked or cabin baggage. Restricted articles include, but are not limited to, compressed
                          gases, corrosives, explosives, flammable liquids and solids, radioactive materials, oxidising materials, poisons, infectious substances
                          and briefcases with installed alarm devices.</h6>

                          you are travelling with. Please contact us prior to travel if you have questions relating to the baggage allowance for your infant.</h6>

                        <h6>Expectant mothers: Airlines have different rules regarding the upper limit beyond which they would permit a pregnant woman to fly. As a
                          general guide, almost all airlines decline to fly a woman beyond 36 weeks of gestation. In the phase between 28-36 weeks, most airlines will
                          require that the passenger bring her doctors letter stating that she is fit to fly and unlikely to go into labour within 36 hours. The cut off
                          points for a woman carrying twins is likely to be much lower. We advise all expectant mothers to check with your GP before making any travel
                          plans and to provide us with a written confirmation of your pregnancy and your GPs letter as detailed above which will be acknowledged in
                          writing by us. This will be passed to the airline so that you may be permitted to board the flight without any hiccups. Without this
                          confirmation and GPs letter in place, you may still be issued with travel documents but we cannot guarantee you will be permitted to fly.
                          As travel agents, we tend to take the word of the passenger as truth when it comes to disclosure of any material fact that may affect the
                          passengers booking including if a female passenger is pregnant and how far along in the pregnancy she is. The travel agency places trust in
                          the pregnant passenger to adhere to the Terms & Conditions and disclose the fact of her pregnancy at time of or before booking.</h6>
                        <h6>In all cases of special or other requests, please remember that in most cases, the booking is made online or over the telephone and we do
                          not get to meet you. Without meeting you, we cannot establish any material fact as to your disability or pregnancy or other special condition
                          which may or may not be apparent physically. We, therefore, require you to disclose any such facts that may affect your booking to us.

                        <h6>Jays Travel offers customers the facility to secure a flight only booking by making a non-refundable deposit payment. The value of the required deposit will depend on the cost of your chosen flights and will be notified to you on the payment page when making an online booking or by our sales agent if you are booking via the telephone.</h6>
                        <h6>When you make a flight booking by paying a deposit, you will be notified at the time of booking of the date by which you must make the final balance payment. This will also be confirmed to you on the booking confirmation sent to you after your booking is confirmed.</h6>
                        <h6>A deposit secures the seat not the price and your fare is likely to increase until full payment is made. Therefore, in order to avoid this and to facilitate our customers, Jays Travel has taken the decision to issue the tickets upon receipt of the deposit payment and pay the airline in full on your behalf upon the understanding that you, the customer, will ensure that the balance payment is made by the due date. However, you will not receive the E-Tickets until you have made payment in full. Failure to make payment by the due date will result in the booking being cancelled automatically. All deposit bookings are set on auto-cancellation and if you do not pay by the due date you will lose the deposit money. There is no exception to this rule so please make sure that you do pay the balance monies on or before the due date.</h6>
                        <h6>If you are having any difficulties in making your balance payment, you must notify us at the earliest opportunity and certainly before the agreed due date, to discuss alternative options. Our sales staff will do their best to assist where possible.</h6>
                        <h6>In the event there is a schedule change ie the airline changes the flight departure dates/times or cancels its operation altogether, you will be offered an alternative flight or a refund. If you decide to cancel, we shall apply for the refund from the airline and will return this to you less our administrative fee of Â£50.00 per person once the airline has refunded us. This is applicable to both those bookings which are paid in full or partly with a deposit.</h6>
                        <h6><b>Please note : Deposit payments are non-refundable in ALL cases: If you can no longer travel and wish to cancel, Tickets to India can provide you with a cancellation invoice to enable you to make an insurance claim.</b></h6>

Please note that, in relation to flights, a 'No-Show' for a flight will result in your ticket being fully cancelled by the airline. In the event of you being registered as a no show, there is no refund value. Any re-issue or change of date will be at the discretion of the airline.
